	 <p>The guidedogs that have visited my computer lab have always amazed me. Sometimes that just means being really patient. Othertimes, it means being responsible for getting through a crowd or to across a busy road. I have seen these dogs help their people accomplish amazing feats.  Plato, Albert, and Katie have all retired now but we say Thanks for the great work!</p></div>
